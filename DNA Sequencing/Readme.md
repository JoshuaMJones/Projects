mutateSequences.java, mutateChildren.java and alignSequences.java are all seperate files under the second assignment and are to do with generating random DNA sequences, mutating them and then matching them up based on how similar they are.
They could have borrowed methods from eachother however it wasn't certain whether they would all be kept together when marked so I duplicated common methods in each file.

sequenceHMM.java is for the third assignment and it is to do with generating different sequences based on a hidden markov model (HMM) and then calculating different probabilites of these sequences appearing based on the model.

All of them use a random number generator from the cern package called Mersenne Twister
