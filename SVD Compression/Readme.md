SVDCompression.java is the file that I made for Q1 in the assignment pdf.
It does an SVD (singular value decomposition) based compression of a picture.
It uses the Jama package for it's matrices since it has libraries for matrix multiplication and certain types of matrix decomposition which were required for the assignment.
